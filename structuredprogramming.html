<h1> What is object oriented programming? </h1>
<p> <strong>Object Oriented programming (OOP)</strong> is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
 It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes),
 which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript,
 C++, Java, and Python. </p>

<p>A class is an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects. Classes often represent broad categories,
 like Car or Dog that share attributes. These classes define what attributes an instance of this type will have, like color,
 but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.</p>

<p>Classes can also contain functions, called methods available only to objects of that type. These functions are defined within
 the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of object.</p>

<p>For example, our Car class may have a method repaint that changes the color attribute of our car. This function is only helpful
 to objects of type Car, so we declare it within the Car class thus making it a method.</p>

<p>Class templates are used as a blueprint to create individual objects. These represent specific examples of the abstract class,
 like myCar or goldenRetriever. Each object can have unique values to the properties defined in the class.</p>

<p>For example, say we created a class, Car, to contain all the properties a car must have, color, brand, and model.
 We then create an instance of a Car type object, myCar to represent my specific car.</p>

<p>We could then set the value of the properties defined in the class to describe my car, without affecting other objects or the class template.</p>

<p>We can then reuse this class to represent any number of cars. </p>



<h1> What is structured programming? </h1>

<p> Structured programming (sometimes known as modular programming) is a programming paradigm that facilitates the creation of programs with 
readable code and reusable components. All modern programming languages support structured programming, but the mechanisms of support, like 
the syntax of the programming languages, varies.</p>

<p>Where modules or elements of code can be reused from a library, it may also be possible to build structured code using modules written in 
different languages, as long as they can obey a common module interface or application program interface (API) specification. However, 
when modules are reused, it's possible to compromise data security and governance, so it's important to define and enforce a privacy policy
 controlling the use of modules that bring with them implicit data access rights.</p>

<p>Structured programming encourages dividing an application program into a hierarchy of modules or autonomous elements, which may, in turn,
 contain other such elements. Within each element, code may be further structured using blocks of related logic designed to improve readability
 and maintainability. These may include case, which tests a variable against a set of values; Repeat, while and for, which construct loops
 that continue until a condition is met. In all structured programming languages, an unconditional transfer of control, or goto statement,
 is deprecated and sometimes not even available.</p>

<h2>Difference between structured and unstructured programming languages</h2>

<p>A structured programming language facilitates or enforces structured programming practices. These practices can also be supported with
 unstructured languages, but that will require specific steps in program design and implementation. Structured programming practices 
 thus date to the emergence of structured programming languages.</p>

<p>The theoretical basis for structured programming goes back to the 1950s, with the emergence of the ALGOL 58 and 60 languages.
 Up to then, code clarity was reduced by the need to build condition/action tests by having programmers write linked tests and 
 actions explicitly (using the goto statement or its equivalent), resulting in what was often called spaghetti code. ALGOL included
 block structure, where an element of code included a condition and an action.</p>

<p>Modular programming, which is today seen as synonymous with structured programming, emerged a decade later as it became clear that reuse
 of common code could improve developer productivity. In modular programming, a program is divided into semi-independent modules, each
 of which are called when needed. Purists argue that modular programming requires actual independence of modules, but most development
 teams consider any program that divides logic into separate elements, even if those elements exist within the same program, as modular.</p>

<p>Modern programming languages are universally capable of producing structured code. Similarly, they're also capable of producing code fairly
 described as unstructured if used incorrectly. Some would say that an unstructured programming language contains goto statements and,
 thus, does not require a "call" to a separate module, which then returns when complete, but that definition is unnecessarily restrictive.
 It's better to say that the mechanisms for enforcing structure vary by language, with some languages demanding structure and other accepting
 less-structured code.</p>

<h2>Types of structured programming</h2>

<p>Structured programming can be divided into three categories, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Procedural programming. Defines modules as "procedures" or "functions" that are called with a set of parameters to perform a task.
 A procedural language will begin a process, which is then given data. It is also the most common category and has recently been subdivided
 into the following:</li>
<ul>

<li>Service-oriented programming simply defines reusable modules as "services" with advertised interfaces.</li>

<li>Microservice programming focuses on creating modules that do not store data internally, and so are scalable and resilient in cloud deployment.</li>

<li>Functional programming, technically, means that modules are written from functions, and that these functions' outputs are derived 
only from their inputs. Designed for serverless computing, the definition of functional programming has since expanded to be largely 
synonymous with microservices.</li>

<li>Object-oriented programming (OOP). Defines a program as a set of objects or resources to which commands are sent.
 An object-oriented language will define a data resource and send it to process commands. For example, the procedural programmer
 might say "Print(object)" while the OOP programmer might say "Tell Object to Print".</li>

<li>Model-based programming. The most common example of this is database query languages. In database programming, units of code are
 associated with steps in database access and update or run when those steps occur. The database and database access structure will
 determine the structure of the code. Another example of a model-based structure is Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), a math-problem
 structure that lends itself to efficient solving of complex expressions. Quantum computing, just now emerging, is another example
 of model-based structured programming; the quantum computer demands a specific model to organize steps, and the language simply provides it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Components of structured programming</h2>
<p>At the high level, structured programs consist of a structural hierarchy starting with the main process and decomposing downward to
 lower levels as the logic dictates. These lower structures are the modules of the program, and modules may contain both calls to other
 (lower-level) modules and blocks representing structured condition/action combinations. All of this can be combined into a single
 module or unit of code, or broken down into multiple modules, resident in libraries.</p>

<p>Modules can be classified as "procedures" or "functions." A procedure is a unit of code that performs a specific task, usually referencing
 a common data structure available to the program at large. Much of the data operated on by procedures is external. A function is a unit
 of code that operates on specific inputs and returns a result when called.</p>

<p>Structured programs and modules typically have a header file or section that describes the modules or libraries referenced and the structure
 of the parameters and module interface. In some programming languages, the interface description is abstracted into a separate file, which 
 is then implemented by one or more other units of code.</p>
